See you later, alligator!
After a while, crocodile!
Stay out of trouble.
I’m out of here.
Okay...bye, fry guy!
If I don’t see you around, I'll see you square.
Stay classy.
Fare thee well.
Catch you on the rebound.
Gotta go, buffalo.
Peace out!
Gotta hit the road.
Long live and prosper!
Well, I'm off!
Smoke me a kipper, I'll be back for breakfast.
Bye bye, butterfly :butterfly:
Gotta get going.
To the winch, wench!
It has been emotional, bye.
Out to the door, dinosaur.
Catch you on the flip side.
Gotta bolt!
See you soon, racoon.
You're still here? It's over. Go back to work. Go!
Don't get run over!
